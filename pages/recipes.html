            <i>Cuban coffee</i> is sweet, rich, and delicious. Traditionally,
            it's served after dinner, and there's no need for dessert when
            you're sharing this beverage with family and friends. It requires a
            special technique that creates shots of espresso with a thick layer
            of foamy crema on top.<br /><br />
            To make <i>Cuban coffee</i>, a 6-cup or 9-cup stovetop espresso
            maker or moka pot work best. Brewing the coffee is easy and
            fine-ground <i>Cuban coffee</i> makes it authentic. Freshly ground
            coffee beans work just as well.

            worth a trip to the city itself, as its fragrant aroma and warming
            flavor make it a delightful break alongside a hot serving of crispy
            and sugary beignets.<br /><br />There's no one without the other. If
            you are a coffee enthusiast, this is a recipe for you. For this
            recipe, you'll need your favorite drip coffee, chicory, and sugar to
            taste if you're used to adding sugar into your hot beverages.
