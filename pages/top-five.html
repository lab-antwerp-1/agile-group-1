              Founded in 2011, they have full quality control over the entire
              process of their store, from bean to cup. They also make a large
              selection of quality teas and lemonades using their own homemade
              syrups – something for everybody here.

              With two locations in Antwerp, the superb coffee here comes
              freshly roasted not far from Caffènation’s location, in their very
              own roastery. This is a real staple of Antwerp’s coffee scene and
              has been going strong for 15 years, constantly one step ahead with
              their artisan coffee philosophy. “One drug. One Nation. One
              Caffènation.” This is extra text.

              With a beautiful La Marzocco in pride of place on the counter, you
              instantly know that you will get a great cup of coffee at this hip
              micro roastery. They roast their coffee in their own roaster in
              Borgerhout, on a state of the art Loring Smartroaster. The
              atmosphere is friendly and relaxed, so it’s a great place to
              chill.

              Viggo’s is a funky Berlin-style coffee bar on a busy square in
              Antwerpen-Noord that’s a lovely place to spend an afternoon. The
              coffee comes from artisan roasters from across the world, such as
              The Barn, Koppi Fine Roasters and 4 Square Mile. If you’ve already
              hit your daily caffeine limit, pop in for fresh baked cookies and
              milk.

              Joke, formerly a barista at Caffénation, opened this absolutely
              banging coffee shop on sun-drenched Eilandje, which has major hip
              hop vibes (Joke is also a DJ) and specialty coffee. There’s MOK
              roaster coffee beans, tasty soft-serve ices for summer and the
              must-try black lemonade.
