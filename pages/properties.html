            The most widespread legend says that mankind discovered the amazing
            properties of coffee thanks to the Ethiopian shepherd named Kaldi.
            One day he noticed that the goats that he grazed on the mountain
            slopes became very agile after eating leaves and berries of some
            wild bush. Succumbing to curiosity Kaldi decided to taste the red
            berries resembling cherry. He felt such an unusual burst of energy
            afterwards that he could stay awake for three days.

            In 1958 coffee was added to the list of foods and beverages
            recognized by the World Health Organization as safe for human
            health. Here is the composition of coffee that makes it good for
            health:

          <p>
            Coffee can help people feel less tired and increase energy levels.
            That’s because it contains a stimulant called caffeine — the most
            commonly consumed psychoactive substance in the world. After you
            drink coffee, the caffeine is absorbed into your bloodstream. From
            there, it travels to your brain. In the brain, caffeine blocks the
            inhibitory neurotransmitter adenosine. When this happens, the amount
            of other neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine
            increases, leading to enhanced firing of neurons.

          <p>
            Caffeine is found in almost every commercial fat-burning supplement
            — and for good reason. It’s one of the few natural substances proven
            to aid fat burning. Several studies show that caffeine can boost
            your metabolic rate by 3–11%.

          <p>
            Caffeine stimulates your nervous system, signaling fat cells to
            break down body fat. But it also increases epinephrine (adrenaline)
            levels in your blood. This is the fight-or-flight hormone, which
            prepares your body for intense physical exertion. Caffeine breaks
            down body fat, making free fatty acids available as fuel. Given
            these effects, it’s unsurprising that caffeine can improve physical
            performance by 11–12%, on average.

            Type 2 diabetes is a major health problem, currently affecting
            millions of people worldwide. It’s characterized by elevated blood
            sugar levels caused by insulin resistance or a reduced ability to
            secrete insulin. For some reason, coffee drinkers have a
            significantly reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.

            affects people over 65, and there is no known cure. However, there
            are several things you can do to prevent the disease from occurring
            in the first place. This includes the usual suspects like eating
            healthy and exercising, but drinking coffee may be incredibly
            effective as well.

          <p>
            Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative
            condition, right behind Alzheimer’s. It’s caused by the death of
            dopamine-generating neurons in your brain. As with Alzheimer’s,
            there is no known cure, which makes it that much more important to
            focus on prevention. Studies show that coffee drinkers have a much
            lower risk of Parkinson’s disease, with a risk reduction ranging
            from 32–60% .

            Your liver is an amazing organ that carries out hundreds of
            important functions. Several common diseases primarily affect the
            liver, including hepatitis, fatty liver disease and many others.
            Many of these conditions can lead to cirrhosis, in which your liver
            is largely replaced by scar tissue. Interestingly, coffee may
            protect against cirrhosis — people who drink 4 or more cups per day
            have up to an 80% lower risk.

            It’s often claimed that caffeine can increase your blood pressure.
            This is true, but with a rise of only 3–4 mm/Hg, the effect is small
            and usually dissipates if you drink coffee regularly. Some studies
            also show that coffee drinkers have a 20% lower risk of stroke.
