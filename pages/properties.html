            The most widespread legend says that mankind discovered the amazing
            properties of coffee thanks to the Ethiopian shepherd named Kaldi.
            One day he noticed that the goats that he grazed on the mountain
            slopes became very agile after eating leaves and berries of some
            wild bush. Succumbing to curiosity Kaldi decided to taste the red
            berries resembling cherry. He felt such an unusual burst of energy
            afterwards that he could stay awake for three days.

            In 1958 coffee was added to the list of foods and beverages
            recognized by the World Health Organization as safe for human
            health. Here is the composition of coffee that makes it good for
            health:

        <p>
          Coffee can help people feel less tired and increase energy levels.
          That’s because it contains a stimulant called caffeine — the most
          commonly consumed psychoactive substance in the world. After you drink
          coffee, the caffeine is absorbed into your bloodstream. From there, it
          travels to your brain. In the brain, caffeine blocks the inhibitory
          neurotransmitter adenosine. When this happens, the amount of other
          neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine increases, leading
          to enhanced firing of neurons.

        <p>
          Caffeine is found in almost every commercial fat-burning supplement —
          and for good reason. It’s one of the few natural substances proven to
          aid fat burning. Several studies show that caffeine can boost your
          metabolic rate by 3–11%.

        <p>
          Caffeine stimulates your nervous system, signaling fat cells to break
          down body fat. But it also increases epinephrine (adrenaline) levels
          in your blood. This is the fight-or-flight hormone, which prepares
          your body for intense physical exertion. Caffeine breaks down body
          fat, making free fatty acids available as fuel. Given these effects,
          it’s unsurprising that caffeine can improve physical performance by
          11–12%, on average.

          Type 2 diabetes is a major health problem, currently affecting
          millions of people worldwide. It’s characterized by elevated blood
          sugar levels caused by insulin resistance or a reduced ability to
          secrete insulin. For some reason, coffee drinkers have a significantly
          reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.

          Alzheimer’s disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease and
          the leading cause of dementia worldwide. This condition usually
          affects people over 65, and there is no known cure. However, there are
          several things you can do to prevent the disease from occurring in the
          first place. This includes the usual suspects like eating healthy and
          exercising, but drinking coffee may be incredibly effective as well.

        <p>
          Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative
          condition, right behind Alzheimer’s. It’s caused by the death of
          dopamine-generating neurons in your brain. As with Alzheimer’s, there
          is no known cure, which makes it that much more important to focus on
          prevention. Studies show that coffee drinkers have a much lower risk
          of Parkinson’s disease, with a risk reduction ranging from 32–60% .

          Your liver is an amazing organ that carries out hundreds of important

          including hepatitis, fatty liver disease and many others. Many of
          these conditions can lead to cirrhosis, in which your liver is largely
          replaced by scar tissue. Interestingly, coffee may protect against
          cirrhosis — people who drink 4 or more cups per day have up to an 80%
          lower risk.
