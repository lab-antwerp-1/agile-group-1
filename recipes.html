            <i>Cuban coffee</i> is sweet, rich, and delicious. 
            Traditionally, it's served after dinner, and there's no need 
            for dessert when you're sharing this beverage with family and friends. 
            It requires a special technique that creates shots 
            of espresso with a thick layer of foamy crema on top.<br><br>
            To make <i>Cuban coffee</i>, a 6-cup or 9-cup stovetop espresso
            maker or moka pot work best. Brewing the coffee is easy and 
            fine-ground <i>Cuban coffee</i> makes it authentic. 
            Freshly ground coffee beans work just as well.
